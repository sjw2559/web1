  <h3>Holy sprit은 누구인가?</h3>

  He loves you. He died at the <strong>cross.</strong>
  Do you know this?<br>

  <p style="margin-top:45px;"><strong>
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target="_blank" title="specification">Why we must read Bible?</a>
  </strong><br>Because Jesus always wants to talk with us. That is why he made human.
  When we read Bible, we can listen his voice in our mind. It's not interactive way but we must hear his voice.
  That means we can understand his mind.</p>

  <p><strong>Why we must pray for our God?<br></strong> God said that he knows everything we need before we pray.
  So why we have to? Jesus also pray. Because God wants to listen our help voice when we are at bad time. It means we lean on our God.
